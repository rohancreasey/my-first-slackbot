## My First Slackbot - readMe Instructions

- Say, *'hello!'*
- Ask slackbot who they are, e.g. *'who are you?'*
- Slackbot likes to make names up, so sometimes you might want to double check, *'what is your real name?'* or just, *'really?'*
- Slackbot keeps a sharp eye on whether you should be getting ready for our course, or studying. Ask it if you *have class today*, and receive some advice.
- Slackbot also likes you to keep a work-life balance, and will tell you so if you're wondering about work on the weekend.
- The closest Slackbot gets to partying is really just hanging out with the user group. Get Slackbot into party mood though by asking about who's in the group; ask *'if X is at the party?'*. 
- And of course, shutdown Slackbot if you want to with standard, shutdown commands (*sleep, shutdown, sd, close*).
- Slackbot will check you really meant got to sleep before it does, just in case!
